## How it all began
---
Like every person that's into cybersecurity, I wanted to do the <a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/pwk-oscp/">OSCP</a><br>
But as it turns out, you gotta be 18 to register. (bummer)<br>
Well I was extremely disappointed and started looking on discord,<br> 
And I found this person who claimed to be an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_Security_Certified_Professional">OSCP</a> at the age of 15,<br>
So they told me about how I needed to mail the guys at Offensive Security<br>
And that they allow people that are under 18 (in some cases)<br>

So I emailed them about this and this was their reply :-<br>
![OSCP Email Reply](/assets/img/posts/ejpt/oscp_email.png)
So <a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/pwk-oscp/">OSCP</a> was canceled for me, atleast for the time being.<br>

### Finding eLearnSecurity
As soon as i got the mail from OffSec saying NO for the <a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/pwk-oscp/">Pwk</a> course<br>
I started looking for alternatives, Looked at a lot of things like <a href="https://www.eccouncil.org/programs/certified-ethical-hacker-ceh/">CEH</a>, <a href="https://www.comptia.org/certifications/pentest">PENTEST+</a>, <a href="https://www.comptia.org/certifications/a">A+</a> etc..<br>
But all of these exams were mcq/theory based, I woudn't be able to get any practical experience in these exams.<br>
So one day, while i was reading blogs, I found this one guy that posted about his <a href="https://elearnsecurity.com/product/ecpptv2-certification/">eCPPT</a> Exam,<br>
I looked it up and realised that there is a whole another world out there.<br>
I was a bit skeptical at first because I had never heard the name <a href="https://elearnsecurity.com/">eLearnSecurity</a> before. But-<br>
After going through some more blogs and reading reviews, I came to the conclusion that I would give the <a href="https://elearnsecurity.com/product/ejpt-certification/">eJPT</a> Exam.<br><br>
Well "Why the eJPT" you ask? ~ Because a lot of people said that its like a steping stone to get to OSCP.

## The Study Begins
---
So, I told my Dad about it and all I got in response were 3 words:-
>Go For It<br>
    ~~ Dad 2020

And that was the final cherry on the cake for me,<br>

### Ine's Starter Pass
I studied the slides thoroughly, watched the Videos and Practised on the labs,<br>
It was a short and sweet course, I was already familiar with like 88% of topics that were discussed there,<br>
Now after ive given the exam, I can say that <a href="https://ine.com/">INE</a> is all you need,<br>
Just Practicing on the Labs should be enough for the Exam.<br>
But I didn't know this back then, and I was feeling a bit nervous <br>
Some people might say that I went a bit OverKill but nevertheless,<br>
I Purchased the <a href="https://academy.tcm-sec.com/p/practical-ethical-hacking-the-complete-course">Practical Ethical Hacking</a> by <a href="https://tcm-sec.com/">TCM</a> <br>

### Practical Ethical Hacking
So Firstly, I would like to say that this course teaches you WAY more than the <a href="https://ine.com/">INE</a> course.<br>
Im not saying that <a href="https://ine.com/">INE</a> is bad or anything, just that this was a amazing course by <a href="https://www.thecybermentor.com/">The Cyber Mentor</a>.<br>
Well, I completed the course and was feeling really Confident in my abilities.
And so on the 25th of December 2020 at around 9:30 ish PM I Asked my Dad to buy the Exam Voucher.

## Exam Day :|
---
Well TBH I didn't really do anything special. <br>
I woke up at 10AM and went out to eat Lunch with my family, <br>
I reached home at 3PM and then started my Exam at around 3:25PM IST. <br>
After Clicking the begin certification process I was instructed to Download the Letter of Engagement,<br>
It had some <b>Very Important</b> details about the exam.<br>
I downloaded my VPN pack and connected to the exam network,<br>
Then I proceeded to do a ping sweep with fping to determine the hosts that were live,<br>
Well then just nmap, dirbuster, smbclient and so on.<br>
Im not sure how much I can say about the exam but ill say this,<br> 
Look at the questions before you start Pentesting,<br>
Because I spent 2 hours doing something that wasn't even necessary.<br>
I got around 18 questions by 5:30PM IST, <br>
The last 2 questions were a pain in the butt, (lol)<br>
So at 9:23PM I finished my exam and started to recheck my answers,<br> 
AND finally at 9:47PM I hit the submit button.<br>

### Results
So I completed Exam in 6 hours 22 minutes.<br>

<br>
Just as I hit the Submit Button, the result came in immediately<br>
![eJPT Result](/assets/img/posts/ejpt/result.png)<br>
I Scored 17/20 with 17 correct answers, 1 Partially correct and 2 wrong answers<br>
Overall I Scored 87.5% and I think that's pretty good.<br>
IMO This was an easy exam overall :)
